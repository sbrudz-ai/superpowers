# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

## Overview

Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural collaborative dialogue.

Start by understanding the current project context, then ask questions one at a time to refine the idea. Once you understand what you're building, present the design in small sections (200-300 words), checking after each section whether it looks right so far.

## REQUIRED FIRST STEP: Check Workflow Hooks

**You MUST do this before ANY other action (including asking questions):**

1. Read `~/.claude/workflow-hooks.yaml` (if not found, try `.claude/workflow-hooks.yaml`)
2. If the file exists, check for `before_design` hooks
3. For each hook where the condition matches (e.g., `if_ui` for UI work):
   - Tell the user: "Invoking **[skill-name]** (triggered by `before_design` hook)"
   - Invoke that skill using the Skill tool
4. Apply the guidance from invoked skills throughout the design process

**Do NOT skip this step.** Even if you think you know what hooks exist, read the file to confirm.

## The Process

**Understanding the idea:**
- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)
- Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea
- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too
- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions
- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria

**Exploring approaches:**
- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning
- Lead with your recommended option and explain why

**Presenting the design:**
- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design
- Break it into sections of 200-300 words
- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense

## After the Design

**REQUIRED: Before saving the design document, check `after_design` hooks:**

1. Re-read `~/.claude/workflow-hooks.yaml` (or `.claude/workflow-hooks.yaml`)
2. Check for `after_design` hooks
3. For each hook where the condition matches:
   - Tell the user: "Invoking **[skill-name]** (triggered by `after_design` hook)"
   - Invoke that skill using the Skill tool
4. Apply guidance (e.g., create ADRs for architectural decisions, build prototypes)

**Documentation:**
- Write the validated design to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
- Use elements-of-style:writing-clearly-and-concisely skill if available
- Commit the design document to git

**Implementation (if continuing):**
- Ask: "Ready to set up for implementation?"
- Use superpowers:using-git-worktrees to create isolated workspace
- Use superpowers:writing-plans to create detailed implementation plan

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions
- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer than open-ended when possible
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features from all designs
- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling
- **Incremental validation** - Present design in sections, validate each
- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense

## Workflow Hooks Reference

This skill supports these hook points (see `hooks/workflow-hooks.md`):

| Hook | When | Example Skills |
|------|------|----------------|
| `before_design` | Start of design process | UX principles, domain modeling |
| `after_design` | After design validated | Architecture decision records |

To configure hooks, create `.claude/workflow-hooks.yaml` or `~/.claude/workflow-hooks.yaml`.
